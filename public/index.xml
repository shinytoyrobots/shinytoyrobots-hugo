          We&#39;re living in a global pandemic. And pandemics, plagues, and apocalypses have always been part of our fiction. Entertainment might need to change the way it portrays those events, to adjust to our new sense of vulnerability.

          In the 1920s and 1930s the US reacted to break up the monopoly and oligopoly of the &#34;robber barons&#34;. The government had the will, and the public backing, to make changes necessary to protect from corporate dominance. That will doesn&#39;t exist any more.

          For some reason, these two genres are always placed together. There&#39;s not a great deal that actually connects them, though. One envisions possible futures, things that might be. The other deliberately looks beyonds the bounds of even potential reality.

      <title>The emotional connection of the 1980s</title>

          The 1980s maintains a strong hold on our culture. It&#39;s reminisced about, idealized, dramatized, and remembered in fiction and in documentaries. Why does it have such a strong emotional hold?

          What makes something dramatic? It is less a case that some things are inherently dramatic, and more that drama stems from unfamiliarity, shock, or strangeness. Variety is dramatic.

          Reflections on what cyberpunk stories written today are supposed to look like. When the real world replicates the dystopian visions of 1980s cyberpunk fiction, what does the genre do today?

          Continuity? That&#39;s so not last week...or this week. Do dragons work properly again? Is there a  white dove to go with that slow motion? Stupidity upon stupidity. Drogon ex machina.

          Not as stupid as last week! Symbology. More symbology. Bludgeoned into your head. Glad that dragon thing wasn&#39;t an issue. Can be summarized in memes. Yaaas, queen.

          I&#39;m an Everton fan, I hate Liverpool. But being Liverpool is nothing compared to Manchester City&#39;s existence as a vehicle to sportswash human rights abuse.

          Quick cut, quick cut, quick cut (by both camera guys and zombies). Enough Unsullied extras! Jon&#39;s poor Tri-Wizard tournament effort. Mel wins her own office dead pool.

          Fighty pirate man avoids the friendzone! Dany goes wild with dragon punning! That awkward &#39;I burned your family alive&#39; moment! Sansa is cooler than you!
