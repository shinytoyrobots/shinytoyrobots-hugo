This recap written &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; while watching.
I chose Yohn Royce, Beric Dondarrion, Brienne, and Gilly in my office Game of Thrones deadpool for this episode.
They showed a lot of mini previews of all the HBO shows that look better than Game of Thrones.
&amp;ldquo;Previously on&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. but that&amp;rsquo;s fine, because previously was just prelude anyways.
On with the idiocy! The credits showed the Winterfell crypt, so I assume everyone is going to die there, too."/>

      <p><em>Obviously there are spoilers</em></p>
<p>This recap written &ldquo;live&rdquo; while watching.</p>
<p>I chose Yohn Royce, Beric Dondarrion, Brienne, and Gilly in my office Game of Thrones deadpool for this episode.</p>
<p>They showed a lot of mini previews of all the HBO shows that look better than Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously on&hellip;&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist. but that&rsquo;s fine, because previously was just prelude anyways.</p>
<h2 id="on-with-the-idiocy">On with the idiocy!</h2>
<p>The credits showed the Winterfell crypt, so I assume everyone is going to die there, too.</p>
<p>Is it fighty time yet? Everyone looks terribly tense. There&rsquo;s hand-wringing, shouting, intense walking. Oh, and Bran stares because that&rsquo;s what Bran does.</p>
<p>Sansa still looks rock in her black leather and stuff. And they actually paid for enough Unsullied extras this season. They seem to have put a lot of people <em>outside</em> the castle, which seems to undermine the reason for having a castle.</p>
<p>Where did Melisandre go again, I forgot? But she&rsquo;s doing magicky stuff. Flaming&hellip;not sword things (arakhs, right?).</p>
<p>Melisandre has Melisandre in her office dead pool.</p>
<p>And now, maybe it actually is fighty time.</p>
<h2 id="wouldnt-bows-have-been-a-good-idea">Wouldn&rsquo;t bows have been a good idea?</h2>
<p>Rather than a cavalry charge with the flaming arakhs, feels like mounted archers with obsidian arrowheads coulda been a way to go. But not as cool for the CGI.</p>
<p>Dothraki flaming swords have no staying power. I mean, as ineffective charges go, that was pretty high up there.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the enemy might be the first effective zombies in history. It did for a moment look like half the office dead pool were gonna die in a nanosecond, but then it was time for Neverending Story again. Didn&rsquo;t Jon get really good at flying a dragon in like one practice session?</p>
<h2 id="stick-em-with-the-pointy-end">Stick &lsquo;em with the pointy end</h2>
<p>A battle so dramatic that you can&rsquo;t actually see who&rsquo;s fighting who. Whatever his name is getting stabbed to death immediately after saving Sam was about as predictable a trope as was possible.</p>
<p>Oh, I tell a lie, Jon didn&rsquo;t get super good at flying dragons. He just flew into that tree, and then crashed into Dany. That would have been amusingly anticlamtic.</p>
<p>Anyways&hellip;<em>run the fuck away!</em> Though, will the zombies be like the ones that climbed over Jerusalem&rsquo;s walls in World War Z?</p>
<p>Props for, for once, GoT showing an effective formation in action. Although I&rsquo;m not quite sure how every named character who&rsquo;s in the front rank of all these formations seems to be surviving.</p>
<p>Mel always was a Johnny Cash fan.</p>
<p>Now the white walkers are channeling Children of the Corn.</p>
<h2 id="meanwhile-in-the-crypt">Meanwhile, in the crypt&hellip;</h2>
<p>Varys with the punning. Tyrion with the quipping. Sansa and Tyrion having a moment, and then another example of &ldquo;we need to tell you how great Dany is&hellip;tell, not show&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="im-going-to-go-now">I&rsquo;m going to go now</h2>
<p>Bran and the rolly eyes. Oh, look, there&rsquo;s the zombie ice dragon.</p>
<p>Well, yes, if you&rsquo;ve got a flame ditch that&rsquo;s three inches wide, then obviously a couple of zombies falling into it will make a bridge. And they only have about a zillion zombies.</p>
<p>&hellip;and <em>now</em> they remember they have bows and arrows?</p>
<p>No, Jon. The Night King has mastered complex maneuvers like hovering, and you just flew into a tree.</p>
<p>Oh, they totally are doing the Jerusalem from World War Z thing.</p>
<h2 id="dramatic-tunes">Dramatic tunes!</h2>
<p>Arya even gets her own music for her cool spinny weapon thing. And&hellip;hark&hellip;contrast her with a frozen-by-fear Hound.</p>
<p>Davos is just &ldquo;what&hellip;the&hellip;fuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyhow, there was a giant. And they gave little Lyanna a little &ldquo;die to kill the big thing&rdquo; death scene.</p>
<p>Also, did Arya lose her cool new weapon in like a second and a half?</p>
<h2 id="that-was-some-of-the-best-flying-ive-ever-see-right-up-to-the-point-where-you-died">That was some of the best flying I&rsquo;ve ever see, right up to the point where you died&hellip;</h2>
<p>You <em>never</em> leave your wing man.</p>
<p>Also, what have they been doing for the last fifteen minutes other than some flying ballet?</p>
<h2 id="visit-your-local-library">Visit your local library</h2>
<p>Why are there a few zombies just browsing in the stacks? A break from being undead so that they can read a good book.</p>
<p>Hodor, hodor, hodor! Oh&hellip;wait.</p>
<p>Actually, the people down in the crypt might have benefitted from a few books to read, rather than just brooding.</p>
<p>+10 dead pool points for me.</p>
<p>Cue sad music and death scene. Bye bye Beric, for a pretty minor character you were OK.</p>
<p>Arya Stark, child of destiny!</p>
<h2 id="meanwhile-back-at-the-big-tree">Meanwhile, back at the big tree</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Make every shot count&rdquo; would have been cool advice to give on the wall.</p>
<p>Also, stop waiting until people are literally two feet away before thinking to use bows.</p>
<h2 id="meanwhile-back-in-the-sky">Meanwhile, back in the sky</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have a wingman. Dany does something useful for one of the first times ever (although let&rsquo;s give Drogon most of the credit).</p>
<p>Bet you a million dollars that dragon fire doesn&rsquo;t kill the night king.</p>
<p>Thanks, I&rsquo;ll take that million dollars.</p>
<p>Jon Snow has a tendency to run in a straight line towards things and then getting completely surrounded, doesn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<h2 id="can-we-have-a-sean-bean-cameo">Can we have a Sean Bean cameo?</h2>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this literally the most predictable thing ever, that all the dead would rise?</p>
<p>And in the crypt, of course (that&rsquo;s why I had Gilly in the dead pool).</p>
<p>Oh, and well done Dany, apparently you just tried to get Drogon killed through basic lack of awareness.</p>
<p>But&hellip;Khaleeeeeeeesi! Where did he come from?</p>
<p>I thought that dragon was dead. Who&rsquo;s dead and who&rsquo;s alive at this point?</p>
<h2 id="stare-vs-stare">Stare vs stare</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bye, dead Theon&rdquo;&hellip;stare&hellip;thanks Bran.</p>
<p>Why do they all do the &ldquo;charge straight at someone like an idiot&rdquo; thing to show heroism?</p>
<p>Is the slow walk just so that there&rsquo;s enough time to have death scenes and stuff for other people?</p>
<p>Jon vs the zombie dragon&hellip;you need &ldquo;Accio Broomstick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh shit, the Night King made Bran look away first. That&rsquo;s some supernatural level staring.</p>
<p>But then ARYA, FOR THE WIN! (That was super cool)</p>
<p>Bye, Jorah. And not even a final groan of &ldquo;Khaleesi&rdquo;. And bye to Melisandre, who gets her ten points from her death pool.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>Cersei all set up to kill everyone. And everyone to try and kill Cersei.</p>
<p>But in the sunshine, now.</p>
<p>(<em>Incidentally, for all that I think Game of Thrones is often ridiculous, this was an oustanding episode and a really good twist on how I thought the Night King stuff was gonna get wrapped up</em>)</p>
