I have Yohn Royce in my office Game of Thrones deadpool for this episode.
I like that there is no episode title on HBO NOW, merely &amp;ldquo;Ep 2: Game of Thrones 69&amp;rdquo;. Though, given some of the show&amp;rsquo;s proclivities, this may just be an episode title.
&amp;ldquo;Previously on&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - marching people. Jon, you&amp;rsquo;re Aegon, you&amp;rsquo;ve been screwing auntie. Death look from Sansa."/>

      <p><em>Obviously there are spoilers</em></p>
<p><strong>This recap written &ldquo;live&rdquo; while watching.</strong></p>
<p>I have Yohn Royce in my office Game of Thrones deadpool for this episode.</p>
<p>I like that there is no episode title on HBO NOW, merely <em>&ldquo;Ep 2: Game of Thrones 69&rdquo;</em>. Though, given some of the show&rsquo;s proclivities, this may just be an episode title.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously on&hellip;&rdquo; - marching people. Jon, you&rsquo;re Aegon, you&rsquo;ve been screwing auntie. Death look from Sansa. You&rsquo;re not my queen Dany! Jaime stare off with the most boring Stark (one of Westeros&rsquo; most hotly contested awards categories).</p>
<h2 id="on-with-the-idiocy">On with the idiocy!</h2>
<p>Straight to a trial, I suppose. Dany, your father was a fantasy medieval land Donald Trump. I am so ridiculously over Dany. Sansa was at least more than a newborn when Jaime roughed up her father.</p>
<p>Big thumbs up for Brienne. And, look, Dany, this is what happens when you&rsquo;re smart enough to take on board new evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the Warden of the North say about it?&rdquo; was a very &ldquo;do what you&rsquo;re told, fuckboy&rdquo; type question. But, then, she doesn&rsquo;t know that he knows that he&rsquo;s a) her nephew and b) the &ldquo;rightful&rdquo; (see last week for how stupid the idea of legitimacy is in this series) heir.</p>
<p>(If they are putting together a &ldquo;Dany turns out like her dad&rdquo; genuine heel turn, Emilia Clarke is doing ok)</p>
<h2 id="we-dont-need-an-arya-shipping-thing">We don&rsquo;t need an Arya shipping thing</h2>
<p>Seriously, Arya and Gendry can be friends. Can we keep it that way?</p>
<p>What are White Walkers like? They&rsquo;re like a million other zombie armies you&rsquo;ve seen in a million terrible movies.</p>
<p>Knife skillz.</p>
<h2 id="could-he-throw-him-out-the-window-again">Could he throw him out the window again?</h2>
<p>Getting thrown out of a window is the most interesting thing Bran ever did.</p>
<h2 id="brothers-back-together">Brothers back together</h2>
<p>Tyrion does seem to have funnier lines when he&rsquo;s in Winterfell. Although he&rsquo;s much less interesting since he became another member of Dany&rsquo;s entourage. And <em>is</em> he convinced that Dany is different? Last time he saw Jaime was just before he&rsquo;d seen her burn some prisoners alive, so&hellip;.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s terribly gloomy. Jaime&rsquo;s like the witty, cheery one now&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="khaleesiiiiiiii">Khaleesiiiiiiii&hellip;</h2>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t heard it in a little while from Jorah.</p>
<p>I think his more subtle advice was &ldquo;learn from your own mistakes, khaleesiiiiii&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sansa looks fucking badass. Black armor and chains and shit. And throwing a little light shade at fake queen. You&rsquo;re at odds because&hellip;&ldquo;I have dragons&rdquo; is not a guide to leadership.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get too soppy, Sansa, though. #YouWouldBeABetterQueen</p>
<p>&hellip;oh, good, you totally didn&rsquo;t. Yeah, what about the fucking north? Look, even tortured eunuchs will travel across the land to serve you. People used to do that for Dany, too.</p>
<h2 id="you-remind-me-of-a-girl">You remind me of a girl</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cry Davos!</p>
<h2 id="if-it-fighty-time-yet">If it fighty time yet?</h2>
<p>Remember, Game of Thrones does good cinema, dumb plot. But I suppose we need to get past some more plot about the battle before the actual battle.</p>
<p>Props to whichever peon put the tactical map together. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our formations, and here&rsquo;s a billion zombies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I wanted to erase the world of men I might start with Bran too, just to make things more interesting in the interim. Couldn&rsquo;t even answer the useful question; &ldquo;does dragonfire work, man who&rsquo;s the memory of the world, apparently?&rdquo; &ldquo;buggered if I know&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Night King strategy is straight up lifted from Edgar and Alan Frog.</p>
<p>Grey Worm thankful that Missandei&rsquo;s answer to &ldquo;what do you want to do?&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;have kids&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sam, killing it with the comebacks on a (not the) wall.</p>
<h2 id="battle-pre-gaming">Battle pre-gaming</h2>
<p>Some random blahness for Jaime and Tyrion. Has Pod put on weight?</p>
<p>Tormund, though, we do love you.</p>
<p>Oh, jeez, we really are doing all the &ldquo;quiet conversations and comings together before the battle&rdquo; stereotypical scenes.</p>
<p>Yep, damn right Arya, let&rsquo;s move on. Please can we fight now? Nope&hellip;we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, laaaaaaaame. I mean, better than sitting on the wall with the Hound and whatshisface, and glad it was all about Arya being in control. But, still.</p>
<p>Please can we fight now? There are only six episodes in this season, right?</p>
<p>Which of Arya using Gendry for sex, or Brienne kneeling to get knighted, counts more towards Westerosi feminism?</p>
<p>Oh, they both got trumped by little lady Lyanna.</p>
<h2 id="still-battle-pre-gaming">Still battle pre-gaming</h2>
<p>Sam, do you know how much that sword is worth?! Lannisters will pay crazy amounts of crowns for that.</p>
<p>Pod&hellip;better than Ed Sheerin. Quiet, reflective montage. Eunuch longing&hellip;Arya reflection&hellip;different eunuch longing&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and we <em>STILL</em> aren&rsquo;t ready to fight.</p>
<p>Has Jon put on weight, too? Looks a little jowlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip;this was my mom. Your stepmom. There&rsquo;s actually a funny story&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is that the first time someone has actually called Dany &ldquo;Dany&rdquo; in show (rather than just everyone else abbreviating it)?</p>
<p>Oh, fucking finally&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="fighty-time">Fighty time!</h2>
<p>Seriously, that&rsquo;s the fucking episode?</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week&hellip;</h2>
<p>All the fucking fighting they pretended last week was going to happen this week.</p>
<h2 id="inside-the-show">&ldquo;Inside the show&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Is there some reason why Brienne and Jaime&rsquo;s relationship needs to be romantic, and not just respectful? Especially when the fact that it&rsquo;s romantic needs to be explained by the show&rsquo;s writers after the show.</p>
