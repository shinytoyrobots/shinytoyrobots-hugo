      <p><em>Obviously there are spoilers</em></p>
<p><strong>This recap written &ldquo;live&rdquo; while watching.</strong></p>
<p>In my office dead pool I&rsquo;d chosen logic, intelligence, subtlety, and the vestiges of respect for the material. Although, really, they&rsquo;re all already dead.</p>
<p>Watching a little late tonight, as was watching WWE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Money in the Bank&rsquo; event beforehand. Certainly I expect that event to have had more subtlety and intelligent twists to a plot than from Weiss and Benioff&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing &ldquo;The Last Watch&rdquo; documentary isn&rsquo;t going to say much about how shitty the last couple of seasons have been. And, seriously, <em>everything</em> HBO previews before Game of Thrones looks better than Game of Thrones, except maybe the ridiculousness that is Westworld (also, &lsquo;Succession&rsquo; is genuinely fucking amazing. If you haven&rsquo;t watched the first season, do so now).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously on&hellip;&rdquo; a reminder of the ridiculousness of last week&rsquo;s dire episode. Cersei screwed over by showrunners, Dany going nutjob genocide for no reason at all, some people dying, others looking regretful. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<h2 id="on-with-the-idiocy">On with the idiocy!</h2>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;pile of ash&rdquo; version of the opening credits King&rsquo;s Landing?</p>
<p>Oh, jeez, Weiss and Benioff didn&rsquo;t just write it, they decided they needed to direct it for the last episode, too&hellip; The only thing <em>D&amp;D</em> about them is that they&rsquo;re chaotic stupid.</p>
<p>Tyrion traipses depressedly through Pompeii. I bet the King&rsquo;s Landing smells terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, look, there&rsquo;s that symbolic horse that that girl-who-is-now-ash was carrying before Arya found her own magic white horse last week.</p>
<p>Tyrion heads for a badly CGI&rsquo;ed background ruin of the Red Keep.</p>
<h2 id="i-sentence-you-to-die">I sentence you to die!</h2>
<p>Grey Worm is about the only person who has some reason for going nuts, really. I&rsquo;d say the tension with Jon was due to excess testosterone, but&hellip;</p>
<p>All those prisoners are &ldquo;speak with the Queen&hellip;but&hellip;wait&hellip;erk&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="oh-look-its-symbolically-snowing">Oh, look, it&rsquo;s symbolically snowing</h2>
<p>Almost like winter <em>was</em> coming!!! Oh, how tricksy of those writers, eh?</p>
<p>Good job on the whole supporting of the potential tyrant, in the face of all evidence, Tyrion&hellip;it&rsquo;s good that he looks a little sheepish now.</p>
<p>I will giggle if he bumps into a Cersei and Jaime &ldquo;hand reaching out of the rocks&rdquo; thing as he explores the tunnels.</p>
<p>That skull doesn&rsquo;t look like it came from a dragon.</p>
<p>Lolz&hellip;giggle giggle. I mean, in a dead way, but still.</p>
<p>And so, we weep over the final resting place of any respect for Brienne&rsquo;s story arc.</p>
<p>Peter Dinklage does a redux of that giant dwarf from Avengers: Infinity War.</p>
<h2 id="has-arya-lost-her-horse-already">Has Arya lost her horse already?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s really blizzarding, isn&rsquo;t it? Oh, no, right, it isn&rsquo;t, IT&rsquo;S SYMBOLIC!</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t there about six Dothraki left after the battle with the Night King (&hellip;remember him? Nobody else does, apparently).</p>
<p>In another piece of super subtle symbology, we&rsquo;re reminded that the tyrant rules through the power of dragons, as the dragon behind her makes her look like she&rsquo;s got dragon wings. Oh, Weiss and Benioff, you masters of the craft.</p>
<p>Who does her hair since Missandei got her head chopped off? It was kinda all over the place last week, in a delicate visual representation of her insanity, but now it&rsquo;s perfect again.</p>
<p>Also, who was the commander of all her forces before this? I mean, congrats to Grey Worm, but still. That was kinda a Prince Baron at the end of Flash Gordon announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will kill everyone until everyone is free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking the wheel, and, by wheel, we mean people.</p>
<p>Has Tyrion learned enough Valyrian at this point?</p>
<p>Awwww&hellip;she&rsquo;s happy that she&rsquo;s loved by all the people who aren&rsquo;t from Westeros. It&rsquo;s sweet.</p>
<h2 id="and-suddenly-were-surprised">And suddenly we&rsquo;re surprised?</h2>
<p>She genuinely looks nonplussed at being called out. It&rsquo;s a little weird.</p>
<p>What exactly is the plan at this point? Persuade her dragon to turn on her (if it&rsquo;s that, that&rsquo;ll be extra special stupid, by the way).</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s queen now.&rdquo; Are you insane, Jon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try telling Sansa.&rdquo; And anyone with any sense.</p>
<p>Honestly, if Dany has any sense, she <em>should</em> just kill Jon, now. And within the context of her character arc of the last three or four minutes, she probably should.</p>
<h2 id="conversations-in-the-cells">Conversations in the &ldquo;cells&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of an overdone trope, these deep conversations in the cells.</p>
<p>Also&hellip;don&rsquo;t they ever have actual cells, rather than ad hoc chaining people up in random rooms? The only time I can remember is when Cersei killed that sand snake that time.</p>
<p>Jon is painfully stupid. A perfect potential alternative to Dany, right? To be fair, he wouldn&rsquo;t have burned the city down, but I think that&rsquo;s mainly because he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the imagination.</p>
<p>Tyrion, for real, does the &ldquo;first they came for the&hellip;and I did not speak up&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do they all admit to loving her, incidentally? I mean, why do they love her?</p>
<p>Good point, though, technically the Night Watch should really step up&hellip;</p>
<p>Fuck off with the &ldquo;rightful heir&rdquo; crap, though. I&rsquo;ve gone over this before. Also, fuck off Jon with the continual &ldquo;she is the queen&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re an idiot. If you get to be king by the end of this, I&rsquo;ll be annoyed.</p>
<h2 id="the-snowash-thing-is-fucking-ridiculous-at-this-point">The snow/ash thing is fucking ridiculous at this point</h2>
<p>But why would Weiss and Benioff choose something less obvious when they can bludgeon you over the head with some symbology instead?</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S AN IRON THRONE! And she walks through the snowash to take her &ldquo;rightful&rdquo; place. Don&rsquo;t slip on all that ice, am I right?!</p>
<p>The main good thing I can say is that Emilia Clarke did a nice channelling of Lena Headey with her expression as she looked at the throne.</p>
<p>Now now&hellip;don&rsquo;t raise your voice to the queen, Jon. It&rsquo;s time for the quiet justification for psychotic murder. And Jon&rsquo;s stupidly heartfelt attempt to try and convince Dany to be nice.</p>
<p>Continuing the Avengers&rsquo; theme, Dany makes Thanos&rsquo; argument for annihilating the entire universe so that nobody remembers anything and can enjoy the brave new world to come.</p>
<p>Woah. I actually didn&rsquo;t entirely see that coming. Wonder if Jon can get away with claiming she fell on the throne awkwardly?</p>
<p>Please &ldquo;Dracarys&rdquo; Jon now, Drogon. It&rsquo;ll be better for everyone. I really really want that. Or eat him, or really anything that kills him.</p>
<p>Or&hellip;just&hellip;burn some bricks&hellip;and melt the throne.</p>
<p>OH, THE SYMBOLOGY! With dramatic music in the background, even. Because dragons know what the fuck thrones are when they&rsquo;ve never seen a throne before.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-theres-justa-dragon-around">And now there&rsquo;s just&hellip;a dragon around?</h2>
<p>Or, what, Drogon just flies off with Dany to whereverness? I mean, I know they didn&rsquo;t have a solution to &ldquo;how to get rid of Dany when there&rsquo;s a huge dragon around&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s a particularly impressive cop out.</p>
<h2 id="marching-somewhere-to-someone">Marching somewhere to someone&hellip;</h2>
<p>I suppose they could do a whole Arthurian myth thing, about how &ldquo;the once and future queen&rdquo; will come back one day&hellip;</p>
<p>HOW THE FUCK DID BRAN GET HERE?</p>
<p>Oh, this is going to be insanely idiotic, isn&rsquo;t it? Everyone can teleport immediately to get into place for some discussion of some thrown together ad hoc council of the characters we remember are still alive.</p>
<p>And, for real, Tyrion? Your solution is &ldquo;choose a king or queen&rdquo;? Whatshisface is a Tully, right? Because this was absolutely the time for the writers to bring some levity to matters&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="democracy">Democracy&hellip;?</h2>
<p>Oh, Sam is going to make the argument for one person, one vote, isn&rsquo;t he? Yep&hellip;he is. Everyone laughed, but still&hellip;</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll leave it up to Tyrion? For no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Choose Sansa.
Choose Sansa.
Choose Sansa.
Choose Sansa.
Choose Sansa.</p>
<p>BRAN? ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE? He&rsquo;s the most boring character on the planet. The only thing he can do is get dragged places and stare at people.</p>
<p>Oh, so it is kind of democratic. It&rsquo;s the Doge of Venice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why anyone gets a vote, Ser Davos. The whole thing is bizarre.</p>
<p>SANSA IS GOING TO BE A QUEEN. SANSA IS GOING TO BE A QUEEN!!!!!!! I AM SO HAPPY! About time a Stark told the rest of the kindom to go jump.</p>
<p>Correct, Tyrion. You absolutely weren&rsquo;t wise.</p>
<p>Grey Worm, you can&rsquo;t be pissed now, you literally just asked Tyrion who should be in charge.</p>
<p>And, blah blah blah, Night&rsquo;s Watch for Jon. But, I suppose, he would be terrible at anything else.</p>
<h2 id="its-getting-like-the-multiple-endings-of-lord-of-the-rings">It&rsquo;s getting like the multiple endings of Lord of the Rings</h2>
<p>Bad painting of the red keep in the background again.</p>
<p>Unsullied can actually go and do some good somewhere.</p>
<p>The North definitely didn&rsquo;t lose a king, they gained a queen.</p>
<p>Arya is the reboot for <em>Kung-fu</em>.</p>
<p>Brienne&rsquo;s summary in the Kingsguard book is; &ldquo;died in the attack on the Red Keep by Dany, some days after the death of his character development&rdquo;. Also, it&rsquo;s ink, she just smudged the shit out of it by slamming the book shut.</p>
<p>Oh, levity again, with the whole chair rearranging.</p>
<p>OH FUCK OFF, &ldquo;A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE&rdquo;, REALLY? Is there going to be a big joke about how it&rsquo;s unfinished?</p>
<p>Is Bran going to get bored with being called &ldquo;the Broken&rdquo; every single time he hears his name? Probably not, he&rsquo;s so immensely boring himself that he probably doesn&rsquo;t get bored.</p>
<p>And now, on to business! But in a fun way, all the jokesters in the council, you know?</p>
<h2 id="and-we-finish-back-at-that-fucking-wall">And we finish back at that fucking wall</h2>
<p>Oh, look, Jon&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And, heeeeey, it&rsquo;s Tormund. Do they have Lord Commanders any more? Who knows? Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Are we still not done yet?</p>
<p>Nope, because&hellip;</p>
<p>SANSA QUEEN, SANSA QUEEN, SANSA QUEEN.</p>
<p>And something about Arya on a ship.</p>
<p>And violins.</p>
<p>And people kneeling and shit. We finish with two competent women, one stupid man, and a dodgy CGI direwolf petting. Oh, look how they fooled us a couple of episodes ago with that non-petting of Ghost.</p>
<p>Sansa&rsquo;s style this season is fire, by the way.</p>
<h2 id="in-an-ideal-world">In an ideal world&hellip;</h2>
<p>Jon randomly gets killed by a last remaining zombie that jumps out from behind a rock.</p>
<p>But no, just a shoot of grass for some last minute SUBTLE SYMBOLOGY!</p>
<p>Jon&rsquo;s a wildling now, I guess. Or something?</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>Watch something good, instead.</p>
<h2 id="inside-the-show">Inside the show</h2>
<p>Thankfully not. Hopefully they felt slightly sheepish. But probably not. They&rsquo;re doing fucking Star Wars, now.</p>
